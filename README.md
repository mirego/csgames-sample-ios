# CS Games - Sample iOS App

This project will guide you setting up your environment to build and run a sample iOS application on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed before beginning:

- Latest version of Xcode (10.1)
- Recent version of the iOS SDK (at least 12.0)

You can download these from the [Apple Developer website](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/).

> **NOTE:** You need a Mac computer running macOS 10.13.6 or later. If you don't have one, you may check our [Sample Android app](https://github.com/mirego/csgames-sample-android/), which can be run on Windows, Linux and older versions of macOS.

## Getting started

First, clone the project from Github and move into its directory:

```
git clone git@github.com:mirego/csgames-sample-ios.git
cd csgames-sample-ios
```

This project uses [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) as a dependency manager. If you don't have it already, install it with the following command:

```
gem install cocoapods
```

Then fetch dependencies and build the workspace:

```
pod install
```

When completed, the project should be ready to open:

```
open "Sample App.xcworkspace"
```

## Building the project

In Xcode, run the project by simply pressing the "Play" button on the top left, or by hitting `⌘R`.

Once the app starts running in the iOS Simulator, your environment is ready for the competition.
